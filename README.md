# D-F-F-verification-
Contains basic operation of the D-F/F . 
Verification environment for D -F/F verification.

Test features :
1. Verifies fundamnetal functionality.
2. Caputre and input D input at every posedge CLK.
3. Test and Simulation with different D values.
4. Ensures flip-flop captures and hold the data at correct CLK edges.

   Modified test for the design:
   The design engineer has modified the D-FF code to handle 1'bx values on the DIN wire. Analyze the modified design code of the D-FF in the instruction to gain a better understanding.
    Additionally, modify the scoreboard to consider DOUT = 1'b0 as valid when DIN = 1'bx and implies "test successful".
